# Welcome

Welcome to this 0.5 day Docker workshop, this page will guide you through ensuring you have the pre-requisites installed and ready before the start of the workshop.
The workshop is a combination of instructor led presentations combined with attendee hands-on exercises with ample opportunities to ask questions.

**Note**: To avoid issues with corporate IT policies if possible please bring a personal laptop with you. For remote workshop attendees 2 screens are particularly helpful and ideally microphone and camera.
